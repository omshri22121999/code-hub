# Strange Numbers

When Varsha was travelling home, she saw a mysterious villa. Varsha is curious about this strange villa and wants to explore it. When she reached the entry gate, the guard gave her a problem to solve and said that he would allow her to enter the villa only if she solved it.

The guard gave Varsha two integers X and K. Varsha needs to determine whether there is an integer A such that it has exactly X positive integer divisors and exactly K of them are prime numbers.

Varsha found this problem really hard to solve. Can you help her?
