# Magic Set

Katya has a sequence of integers a1,a2,…,an and an integer m.

She defines a good sequence of integers as a non-empty sequence such that the sum of the elements in each of its non-empty subsequences is divisible by m.

Katya wants to know the number of good subsequences of the sequence a. Can you help her?

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers n and m.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers a1,a2,…,an.

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good subsequences.

## Example Input

```
2
2 3
1 2
2 3
1 3
```

## Example Output

```
0
1
```
