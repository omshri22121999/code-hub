# Candies And Two Sisters

There are two sisters Alice and Betty. You have 𝑛 candies. You want to distribute these 𝑛 candies between two sisters in such a way that:

Alice will get 𝑎 (𝑎>0) candies;
Betty will get 𝑏 (𝑏>0) candies;
each sister will get some integer number of candies;
Alice will get a greater amount of candies than Betty (i.e. 𝑎>𝑏);
all the candies will be given to one of two sisters (i.e. 𝑎+𝑏=𝑛).
Your task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute exactly 𝑛 candies between sisters in a way described above. Candies are indistinguishable.

Formally, find the number of ways to represent 𝑛 as the sum of 𝑛=𝑎+𝑏, where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are positive integers and 𝑎>𝑏.

You have to answer 𝑡 independent test cases.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains one integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤104) — the number of test cases. Then 𝑡 test cases follow.

- The only line of a test case contains one integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤2⋅109) — the number of candies you have.

## Output

For each test case, print the answer — the number of ways to distribute exactly 𝑛 candies between two sisters in a way described in the problem statement. If there is no way to satisfy all the conditions, print 0.
