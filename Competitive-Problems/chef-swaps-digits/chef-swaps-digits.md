# Chef Swaps Digits

Chef has two positive integers A and B. He can tamper with them by choosing a digit in the decimal representation of A and a digit in the decimal representation of B and swapping these digits. This operation may be performed at most once.

Find the maximum possible sum of the resulting numbers which Chef can obtain.

(Note : 1≤A,B≤99)

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B.

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum sum.

## Example Input

```
3
13 82
9 24
20 30
```

## Example Output

```
104
96
