# Sell All The Cars

Chef owns N cars (numbered 1 through N). He wishes to sell all of them over N years by selling exactly one car per year. For each valid i, the initial price of the i-th car is Pi. Due to depreciation, the price of each car decreases by 1 unit per year until it is sold.

Note that the price of a car cannot drop below 0 no matter how many years have passed, i.e. when the price of a car reaches 0 in some year, it remains 0 in all subsequent years.

Find the maximum profit Chef can make if he sells his cars in an optimal way. Since this number may be large, compute it modulo 1,000,000,007 (109+7).

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PN.

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum profit Chef can make, modulo 1,000,000,007
