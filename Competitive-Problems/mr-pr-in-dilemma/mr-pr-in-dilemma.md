# Mr Pr In Dilemma

Mr. Pr and Ms. Ad are at a and b respectively on an infinite number line. Mr. Pr wants to meet Ms. Ad.

Mr. Pr can choose to move c or d units in 1 second. If Mr. Pr moves c units then Ms. Ad will move d units and vice versa. (Both of them always moved in positive x-direction)

You have to determine if Mr. Pr can meet with Ms. Ad after some integral amount of time, given that Mr. Pr chooses optimally. Note that meeting after a fractional amount of time does not count.

## Input

- First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- Each testcase contains four space separated integers, a, b, c, and d.

## Output

For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if Mr. Pr meets with Ms. Ad, otherwise "NO".

## Example Input

```
2
3 4 1 2
10 20 3 7
```

## Example Output

```
YES
NO
```
